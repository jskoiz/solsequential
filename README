# Solana Sequential Address Search with Activity Checker

Prints Solana wallet addresses and checks their transaction activity on the Solana blockchain from a specified mnemonic phrase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- An environment file (.env) with your Solana mnemonic phrase (MNEMONIC) and other configurations (see .env.example)

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-address-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd solana-address-generator
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Edit the .env file with your Solana mnemonic phrase.

2. Run the script:
```
npm start
```

The script generates Solana wallet addresses, checks their activity, and saves results in solana_addresses.csv.

## Configuration

You can adjust the number of addresses and other settings in the script. Modify the numberOfAddresses variable and Solana network URL in the generateSolanaAddresses function.
